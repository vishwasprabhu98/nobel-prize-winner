## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Handling CORS Issues

If you encounter a CORS error while making API requests, follow these steps:

Start the proxy server by running:

```
npm run server
```

This will run the server in `http://localhost:3000`

Update the API base URL in environment.ts to point to the local proxy server.


## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
